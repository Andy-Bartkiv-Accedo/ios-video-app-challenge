1. Implement a basic app (layout + functionality) that is expected to navigate between three tabs (Home, Search, User), and from the Home tab to Details and then to the Player view.
2. Once a basic application is created, build logic to fetch data from TMDB API and get info from there in order to populate the app: Home and Details Page.
3. Make the app more efficient and reduce the number of calls to the back end by storing the retrieved elements from TMDB in the App State Manager.
4. Add a Player view of the app, and implement a Player to be able to play test-stream video.
5. Implement custom Player UI (??? TBD)
